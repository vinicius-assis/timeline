- How long you spent on the assignment.

Around 6 hours talking about the architecture and coding

- What you like about your implementation.

I liked the folder organization, and the isolation of components and functionalities

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.

Maybe changes to improve the layout and user experience

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

I conducted some research on timeline templates and gathered ideas to create my own timeline. I incorporated elements from various timeline examples that I liked, aiming to build a great experience with these components.

- How you would test this if you had more time.

I would start by testing the logical part, grouping events by date and creating periods. Then I would move on to the components, checking the rendering and styling of each one.
